# Backy Handoff Notes (2026-02-24)

## Current active directory
- Working repo is now: `/Users/devanshvarshney/Downloads/Scythian /backy`
- This is the directory to continue from in future sessions.

## What was completed in latest pass
- Renamed branding references to the product/repo name `backy`.
- README and setup docs now reference `backy` paths.
- Removed old `backy-cms` duplicate/stale folder under `/Users/devanshvarshney/Downloads/Scythian `.
- Project metadata aligned to `backy` in:
  - `/Users/devanshvarshney/Downloads/Scythian /backy/package.json` (repo URL updated)
  - `/Users/devanshvarshney/Downloads/Scythian /backy/package-lock.json` (root lockfile name updated)

## Important note about remaining `backy-cms` strings
- Strings in package names such as `@backy-cms/*` and files like `specs/backy-cms-completion-spec.md` are intentionally preserved for package scope and are not part of repo-folder naming.
- Only stale folder/path references and README/path references were cleaned.

## Commit status
- Initial commit is now being created from this exact directory state.

## Continue points
- Next chat should proceed from this repo root and this handoff file first if context is needed.
